# Ingredient Recognition with Vision Transformern

This repository contains the code for the master thesis "Identifikation von Lebensmitteln in Fotos von Mahlzeiten mit Transformern" (engl. "Identification of Ingredients in Pictures of Food with Transformers") by Anja Hirsch at HTW Berlin.

## Fine-Tuning Vision Transformer
Vision Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have shown remarkable potential in image recognition tasks. This project explores the application of Vision Transformers to ingredient recognition in food images, leveraging their powerful architecture for this specific challenge. The implementation and investigation of this approach can be found in the notebook `fine_tuning_vit.ipynb`, which examines the effectiveness of adapting Vision Transformers for ingredient identification in food pictures.
