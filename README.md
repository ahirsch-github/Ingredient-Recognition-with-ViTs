# Ingredient Recognition with Vision Transformern

This repository contains the code for the master thesis "Identifikation von Lebensmitteln in Fotos von Mahlzeiten mit Transformern" (engl. "Identification of Ingredients in Pictures of Food with Transformers") by Anja Hirsch at the HTW Berlin.

## Fine-Tuning Vision Transformer

Vision Transformers have shown great potential in the field of image recognition. The model architecture is based on the Transformer architecture, which has already proven its effectiveness in the field of natural language processing. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether Vision Transformers can also be used for the task of ingredient recognition.

The implementation can be found in the notebook `fine_tuning_vit.ipynb`.
